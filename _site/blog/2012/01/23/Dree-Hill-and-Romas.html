<h1>Dree Hill & Roma's</h1>
<hr size="4" color="black">
 <p>Headed over to Dromara and on over Dree Hill today, not sure it was one of
my better ideas. Dree Hill was as hard as usual I was even chased up by a
hedge cutter, but we got there in the end, alough I don't think I had enough
to eat and I ran out of energy on the way home, a hard day as it was a head
wind out and quite cold.</p><p>When I got home Flo was in a horrible mood, very demotivated and grumpy, so
we decided a night out was called for. Roma's was the venue and a nice meal it
was. Flo had the brain wave of going to the Open House for coffee which we did
and it was a  nice end to the evening. Flo now in a slightly better mood.</p>
