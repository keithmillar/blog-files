<h1>Tour Of the Glens</h1>
<hr size="4" color="black">
 <p>Road the Tour of the Glens today for the first time in about eight years. We had the best weather for many a year, except for the brutal 60 mile cross head wind all the way home. The wind was so strong that in places I could not take my hand off the bars to drink, and I was nearly blown off on the battery. Apart for the wind the ride was great with the hills not seeming as hard as I remembered, perhaps it was the blue sky and warm sunshine. Even the roads where very quite with little or no traffic. Rode a fir bit on my own today as the groups were just too fast but I still managed to pass a few people and finished ahead of quite a few club members.</p>
