<h1>Feburary and another Baby</h1>
<hr size="4" color="black">
 <p>This month was a bit more eventful than last month. I started to get some serious miles in on the bike and I managed to get my first 100 miler of the year today (28th). However the weight loss is not going to plan so I will have to work on this.</p>

<p>On th 7th Amber Louise O&#8217;Brien was born so the following Sat we headed down to Dublin for the usual ooing and aahing, even got to see Barbra breast-feeding!Â  Harry, Kath and Jane arrived just after Tommy rushed off to the bookies.</p>

<p>The following weekend Frank and Kath stayed with us and we had a great time with a lovely meal in Zen a Japanese restaurant in Belfast, we had a super 5 course meal, wish I had remembered to take photo. The Keanes may visit again soon as they ordered covers for conservatory furniture which will be ready in a few weeks.</p>

<p>Had to buy a new wheel for the Fuji not impressed but it was needed, so I also change the front to a fairly new spare I had.</p>

<p>Saturday 26th Flo and I went to the boathouse for our anniversary dinner (18 yrs) the food was lovely, but the venue was a bit cramped, but we still had a good night.Must go out more often.</p>
